**Welcome to the r_comparisons repository! In a nutshell, this repository is about looking at and comparing different means that achieve the same objective in R.**

### Comparison 1: data.frame() vs. tibble() vs. data.table()
The first comparison investigates whether data.frames, tibbles, and data.tables differ in the computational time they need for creating a dataset with random numbers. Read the post [here](1_creating_a_dataset_DF_TBL_DT.md).

### Comparison 2: aggregating big data—Base R vs the tidyverse package vs the data.table package
Comparison № 2 assesses the performance of Base R, the tidyverse package, and the data.table package in running an aggregation command for big data. Read the post [here](2_aggregating_big_data.md).
