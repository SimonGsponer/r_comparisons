**Welcome to the r_comparisons repository! In a nutshell, this repository is about looking at and comparing different means that achieve the same objective in R.**

### Comparison 1: data.frame() vs. tibble() vs. data.table()
The first comparison investigates whether data.frames, tibbles, and data.tables differ in the computational time they need for creating a dataset with random numbers. Read the post [here](1_creating_a_dataset_DF_TBL_DT.md).
